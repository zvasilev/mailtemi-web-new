1. ###### Why are there no push notifications?
    Push notifications will be available only for protocols that support this feature by design, such as JMAP, MSGraph, and the Gmail API.
    IMAP does not have a secure standard for push notifications.
    Implementing this would require access to the user's password, which is not acceptable and will not be supported by Mailtemi.

2. ###### Monetization
    Our goal is to build a free and fast email app.
    However, features like push notifications, which require a proxy service and incur traffic costs, will require a subscription.

3. ###### How are credentials stored?
    Mailtemi follows the best practices of Apple Keychain services to ensure your credentials are stored securely. 
    During setup, account details, app passwords, API tokens, etc., are securely saved via Apple Keychain services. 
    You can read more about it [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services).

4. ###### My mail service is not listed in "Add Account" in the app.
    Many email service providers offer "App passwords" or "API tokens" that you can generate specifically for Mailtemi.
    This authentication mode("App passwords" or "API tokens") is supported for JMAP/IMAP protocols.

5. ###### What protocols are supported?
    Mailtemi supports JMAP, IMAP, MSGraph, CarDAV, and Google People protocols.
    Currently, these protocols are used for email synchronization and enhancing emails with the correct avatar and display name.
