1. ###### Why are there no push notifications?
    Push notifications will be available only for protocols that support this feature by design, such as JMAP, MSGraph, and the Gmail API.
    IMAP does not have a secure standard for push notifications.
    Implementing this would require access to the user's password, which is not acceptable and will not be supported by Mailtemi.

2. ###### Monetization
    Our goal is to build a free and fast email app.
    However, features like push notifications, which require a proxy service and incur traffic costs, will require a subscription.
	
3. ###### Email Synchronization
   The iOS app prioritizes downloading the emails users are most likely to read. This includes:
   - Unread emails
   - Non-marketing/forum emails
   - Emails with smaller body sizes
   This prioritization allows users to see the content they care about as quickly as possible. When a user clicks to view an email, the app refreshes and updates priorities to display the most relevant content.
  
4. How does resynchronization of email flags and deletions work?
	Mailtemi keeps email flags and deletions up-to-date under specific conditions:
   - Every 10 minutes when Mailtemi is active
   - Manual refresh through "Pull to refresh" for an explicit update
   Still the speed of resynchronization vary by email provider :(
   - JMAP: Offers more efficient synchronization with dedicated methods for querying specific email state changes.
   - IMAP: Requires multiple queries from the latest to the earliest UID in the cache, which can result in longer sync times, especially if there are large ID gaps due to copy/move operations.

3. ###### How are credentials stored?
    Mailtemi follows the best practices of Apple Keychain services to ensure your credentials are stored securely. 
    During setup, account details, app passwords, API tokens, etc., are securely saved via Apple Keychain services. 
    You can read more about it [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services).

4. ###### My mail service is not listed in "Add Account" in the app.
    Many email service providers offer "App passwords" or "API tokens" that you can generate specifically for Mailtemi.
    This authentication mode("App passwords" or "API tokens") is supported for JMAP/IMAP protocols.

5. ###### What protocols are supported?
    Mailtemi supports JMAP, IMAP, MSGraph, CarDAV, and Google People protocols.
    Currently, these protocols are used for email synchronization and enhancing emails with the correct avatar and display name.
