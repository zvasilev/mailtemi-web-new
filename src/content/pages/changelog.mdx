**Improved Error Messages for Easier Troubleshooting**  
This update enhances error handling, especially for JMAP users, making it easier to understand and resolve email issues.

- **More Informative Error Messages** – Instead of vague failures, Mailtemi now provides clearer explanations when sending or receiving emails.
- **JMAP-Specific Enhancements** – Error responses from JMAP now include additional context, such as whether an issue is due to account restrictions, network problems, or server errors.
- **Better Identification of Connection Failures** – Mailtemi now distinguishes between different failure points, such as authentication issues, network restrictions, or server downtime.
- **Improved UI for Troubleshooting** – When possible, the app retains server-provided details while simplifying error titles for easier understanding.

- Auto-discovery of set-up accounts doesn't add OAuth scopes, causing later reauthentication errors.
- Error messages could cause the Settings screen to pop up.

Mailtemi now supports OpenID Connect for secure authentication.
   Supported methods include:

- **IMAP SRV Lookups** - Using DNS SRV records, Mailtemi identifies your email provider’s IMAP and SMTP servers for seamless configuration.
- **Microsoft AutoDiscover for MSGraph** - For Microsoft-based accounts, including Office 365, Mailtemi leverages AutoDiscover to securely fetch the necessary settings.
- **Well-Known URL Lookup** - For providers using standard configuration URLs, Mailtemi ensures your account is set up with minimal effort.

**Secure Authentication via OpenID**  
Mailtemi now supports OpenID Connect for secure authentication. Your password remains private between you and your mail server, while the app securely receives only the necessary security tokens.

- **OpenID Connect Discovery** – Automatically discover relevant OIDC endpoints via the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint.
- **OpenID Dynamic Client Registration** – Automatically authenticate with the server via OAuth with the OIDC provider, without requiring explicit email app-to-email server setup.

- Enhanced Account Setup via JMAP: Setting up accounts through JMAP has been improved, offering smoother configuration.

- Support for Partial URLs on Self-Hosted Servers: The app now supports self-hosted servers that provide only partial URLs. In these cases, the URL is automatically prepended with the JMAP `./well-known` DNS SRV record for accurate configuration.

- Custom 'From' Field Editing: Users can now edit the 'From' field using a literal address format like `*@my-domain.com` for JMAP catch-all send identities, allowing for more flexible email management.

- Improved Draft Email Handling: Draft emails now utilize blob IDs instead of fetching the entire email content, optimizing performance and data usage.

- On-Demand Folder Creation for Standalone Servers: For standalone servers like Stalwart and Cyrus IMAP, which do not come with predefined folders, the app now automatically creates necessary folders like "Draft" and "Sent" when sending emails.

- Fallback Email Address for Invalid Send Identities: If a Send Identity lacks a valid email address, the app will automatically use the email address from the setup account, ensuring seamless email delivery.

- Avatar Refresh Handling: When refreshing avatars, if a temporary error (such as a timeout) occurs, the app now retains the current avatar icons instead of stripping them.

- Enhanced UI Error Reporting: Improved the accuracy and clarity of error messages throughout the app, making it easier for users to identify and resolve issues.
