- Enhanced Account Setup via JMAP: Setting up accounts through JMAP has been improved, offering smoother configuration.

- Support for Partial URLs on Self-Hosted Servers: The app now supports self-hosted servers that provide only partial URLs. In these cases, the URL is automatically prepended with the JMAP `./well-known` DNS SRV record for accurate configuration.

- Custom 'From' Field Editing: Users can now edit the 'From' field using a literal address format like `*@my-domain.com` for JMAP catch-all send identities, allowing for more flexible email management.

- Improved Draft Email Handling: Draft emails now utilize blob IDs instead of fetching the entire email content, optimizing performance and data usage.

- On-Demand Folder Creation for Standalone Servers: For standalone servers like Stalwart and Cyrus IMAP, which do not come with predefined folders, the app now automatically creates necessary folders like "Draft" and "Sent" when sending emails.

- Fallback Email Address for Invalid Send Identities: If a Send Identity lacks a valid email address, the app will automatically use the email address from the setup account, ensuring seamless email delivery.

- Avatar Refresh Handling: When refreshing avatars, if a temporary error (such as a timeout) occurs, the app now retains the current avatar icons instead of stripping them.

- Enhanced UI Error Reporting: Improved the accuracy and clarity of error messages throughout the app, making it easier for users to identify and resolve issues.
