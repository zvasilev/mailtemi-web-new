Mailtemi is now live on the Play Store!
Not a beta-just a slow start. Most of the code is shared with iOS, so
email features should work fine, though some UI glitches are expected.


The first Android update is out, fixing some ugly UI issues. Jetpack
Compose makes development easy, but updating certain UI parts can be
tricky. As the sole developer, I have to spend time where it matters
most---keeping the backend solid and consistent with iOS.

The next Android update will focus on fixes. Dark mode is still not
consistent, and avatars don't refresh if they're fetched after first
being displayed. Some other quirks---like a row being swiped when
scrolling quickly---I'll leave until Android libraries become more
stable. As a sole developer, I'm betting on the latest Android UI
libraries, but some of them are still in alpha and bring their own rough
edges.

Contacts are still very limited, but the plan is to combine them with
Calendars once JContacts and JSCalendar become official RFCs. This work
is being implemented in parallel with iOS.
