In the ever-evolving landscape of digital communication, finding the right balance between security and rich content can be challenging. 
However, Markdown offers a powerful solution that provides both safety and engaging content without the complexities and risks associated with HTML. 
At Mailtemi, we are excited to fully embrace Markdown and bring its benefits to your email experience.

### The Security Risks of HTML Emails:
HTML emails, while visually appealing, come with significant security risks. 
They can include embedded scripts, external content, and hidden elements that can be exploited by attackers. 
Phishing attempts often rely on these vulnerabilities, making HTML emails a potential threat to your privacy and security.

### Markdown: A Lost Opportunity No More:

	Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create formatted text using a plain text editor. 
	It offers a wide range of formatting options such as headings, lists, links, and emphasis (bold or italic text), all without the security vulnerabilities inherent in HTML.

	Here’s why Markdown is a alternative.

### Mailtemi’s Commitment to Markdown:
    At Mailtemi, we are taking significant steps to embrace Markdown fully:
	1. Markdown Composition.
	   We offer comprehensive support for composing emails with Markdown, providing you with the tools to create rich content securely and effortlessly.
	2. HTML to Markdown Conversion.
	- When emails contain only an HTML part, our app automatically converts the content to Markdown. This conversion retains essential formatting elements such as headings, bold, and italic text, while stripping away potentially harmful elements.
	- By doing this, we utilize native UI elements, avoiding the need for WebView. This approach protects you from zero-day exploits and subtle tracking methods via CSS links with unique images.

### Transforming Email Communication:
    At Mailtemi, we believe that Markdown is a missed opportunity no more. By integrating Markdown into your email workflow, you can enjoy the best of both worlds: rich, formatted content and robust security. Our app’s ability to convert HTML to Markdown ensures that all your communications remain safe, readable, and engaging.
