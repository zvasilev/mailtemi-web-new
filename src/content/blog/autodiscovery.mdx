Mailtemi simplifies the process, making it as easy as entering your email address. Whether you’re an email wizard or a first-timer, Mailtemi’s streamlined approach to automatic and manual configuration has you covered.

## Automatic Configuration: How It Works

Mailtemi prioritizes speed and security by using modern protocols and authentication methods. Here’s how Mailtemi smartly handles automatic email configuration:

### 1. **JMAP First: The Modern Protocol**
Mailtemi starts by looking for JMAP (JSON Meta Application Protocol) support. JMAP is a cutting-edge protocol that simplifies email synchronization and configuration. The steps are:

- **Dynamic Client Registration:** Mailtemi checks if your email provider supports JMAP with OpenID Connect (OIDC) using Dynamic Client Registration. If successful, it retrieves the JMAP service endpoint and proceeds with configuration.
- **DNS SRV Record:** If Dynamic Client Registration fails, Mailtemi searches for a DNS SRV record (e.g., `jmap._tcp.example.com`) to locate the JMAP service. JMAP’s standardized approach avoids the need for fuzzy logic, ensuring accurate results.

### 2. **Fallback to IMAP/SMTP**
If JMAP isn’t available, Mailtemi switches to discovering IMAP/SMTP settings. Multiple methods are employed in parallel to save time:

- **DNS SRV Records:** It looks for records like `_imaps._tcp.<domain>` and `_submission._tcp.<domain>` to locate IMAP and SMTP servers.
- **HTTP Auto-Configuration File:** If no DNS SRV records are found, Mailtemi tries HTTP-based discovery. It queries URLs such as:
  - `https://autoconfig.<domain>/mail/config-v1.1.xml?emailaddress=<email>`
  - `https://<domain>/.well-known/autoconfig/mail/config-v1.1.xml?emailaddress=<email>`
  
  The server settings are extracted from the returned XML file.
- **Mozilla ISP Database (ISPDB):** As a backup, Mailtemi queries the Mozilla ISP Database at `https://autoconfig.thunderbird.net/v1.1/<domain>` for known server settings. Thanks Mozilla/Thunderbitd!
- **MX Record Lookup:** If other methods fail, Mailtemi performs an MX record lookup to identify the mail server. For well-known providers like Fastmail or Outlook, pre-configured settings are applied automatically.
- **Fuzzy Logic:** As a last resort, Mailtemi uses heuristic techniques to guess server settings based on common patterns. This is slower and less reliable but can succeed when all else fails.

### 3. **OAuth or Manual Configuration**
Once Mailtemi identifies the server settings, it’s time to authenticate:

- For OAuth/OIDC-enabled servers, Mailtemi launches the authentication page to obtain the necessary tokens.
- For other configurations, it displays the connection settings (JMAP/IMAP) to finalize the setup.

If all automatic methods fail, Mailtemi provides a manual setup option, allowing you to enter the required server details yourself.

## Setting Up Your Email Server for Auto-Configuration

To ensure a seamless experience for your users, follow these best practices:

1. **Enable JMAP Support:** JMAP simplifies synchronization and configuration. Implement OIDC with Dynamic Client Registration to make setup effortless for your users.
2. **Publish DNS SRV Records:** Include records for JMAP, IMAP, and SMTP to guide applications to your servers.
3. **Provide Auto-Configuration Files:** Host configuration files at standardized URLs (e.g., `.well-known/autoconfig`) to support HTTP-based discovery.
4. **Register with ISP Databases:** Ensure your server settings are listed in public databases like Mozilla’s ISPDB.
5. **Optimize MX Records:** Clearly define your mail server domains and consider using subdomains to separate email traffic.

By implementing these measures, you’ll make life easier for your users and ensure compatibility with Mailtemi and other email clients.

## Dynamic Client Authentication!

There is a server offering dynamic client authentication called stalw.art, and Mailtemi is fully interoperable with it. This authentication method provides several advantages:

No User Passwords: The email client does not store or manage the user’s main password. Instead, it receives a token through OIDC, limiting access to only what is authorized by the server. This ensures no unauthorized API access to other resources.

Two-Factor Authentication: Dynamic client authentication supports two-factor authentication via the mail server’s OIDC provider, adding an extra layer of security.

Enhanced Infrastructure Hosting: Unlike the status quo, which restricts secure email hosting to a few providers, dynamic client authentication enables you to host a fully secure email infrastructure.

## Why Mailtemi Stands Out

Mailtemi combines speed, security, and user-centric design to deliver a superior email setup experience. By leveraging modern protocols like JMAP and robust authentication methods such as OAuth and API keys, it ensures that your email is not only easy to configure but also secure and reliable.

Say goodbye to the frustration of email setup and let Mailtemi handle the heavy lifting. Try it today and experience the difference!
