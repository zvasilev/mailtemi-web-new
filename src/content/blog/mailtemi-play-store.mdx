Mailtemi for Android was in beta for a while—now it’s almost ready for Google Play.

The delay was due to two things:  
– I took a short break (sole dev—what can you do).  
– I had to update everything Google deprecated last year, especially around navigation:  
[Jetpack Navigation 3 for Compose](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/05/announcing-jetpack-navigation-3-for-compose.html)  
Navigation 3 introduces a simpler, more predictable API tailored for large-screen and multi-window devices. The previous version was deprecated immediately.

This update also prepares Mailtemi for Android’s future—foldables, tablets, and desktop environments:  
[Custom layouts in Navigation 3](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-3/custom-layouts)  
The new layout system allows apps to better adapt to dynamic screen configurations and custom containers, like split-screen or desktop modes.

My Google Play developer account is finally active. A test build is ready, and Play Store screenshots are coming next.

Before publishing, Google requires at least 20 users to test the app for a short period to confirm it’s not spam.  
If you’re on Android 13 or later and want early access, I’d really appreciate the help.
