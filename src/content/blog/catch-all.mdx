One Inbox to Rule Them All

Ever wished you could manage all your emails in one place without worrying about different addresses? With Mailtemi, you can handle multiple email types—primary, alias, masked, and catch-all—effortlessly in a single inbox.

## Why Do You Need This?

Your primary email address is straightforward; it’s the one provided by your email service. But sometimes, you need more flexibility. That’s where aliases, masked emails, and catch-all addresses come in.

## Useful Use Cases

- **Aliases** – Instead of always using `support@your-domain.com`, you can create an alias for mailing lists or professional use, like `john.doe@your-domain.com`.
- **Masked Email** – Ideal for signing up for marketing newsletters. They work like aliases but are auto-generated when you register for a service.
- **Catch-All** – Available for custom domains. It ensures you receive emails even if the sender mistypes your address, e.g., `supprt@your-domain.com` instead of `support@your-domain.com`.

## UI Representation

Knowing how an email reached your inbox can be helpful:

- **Primary Address** – Likely important emails.
- **Alias** – Predefined context, often for work or specific groups.
- **Masked Email** – Not spam, but possibly unimportant (e.g., newsletters).
- **Catch-All** – Might need a later review.

## Security & Privacy Considerations

Using masked emails and catch-all addresses can enhance security and privacy by reducing spam exposure and minimizing the risk of phishing attacks. Instead of sharing your primary email with every service, masked emails provide a unique, disposable alternative. Catch-all addresses ensure no email is lost due to typos but require careful monitoring to avoid phishing attempts. Consider setting up filters or rules to automatically sort and identify emails from unknown sources.

## Filtering & Organization Tips

Managing multiple email types efficiently requires a structured approach. Here are some ways to keep your inbox organized:

- **Labels & Folders** – Assign specific labels or move masked emails to a separate folder to de-clutter your primary inbox.
- **Automated Rules** – Create filters to flag emails sent to masked addresses, making it easier to distinguish between essential and non-essential emails.
- **Notification Settings** – Reduce distractions by configuring notifications only for primary and alias emails, while keeping masked and catch-all messages silent until reviewed.

## Creating Non-Primary Email Addresses

Currently, this functionality is available only for **JMAP** accounts, which clearly separate email address roles:

- **Aliases** can be managed in settings.
- **Masked Emails** are automatically generated for newsletter signups. While Mailtemi does not yet support their creation, viewing and managing existing ones is possible.
- **Catch-All** is simply indicated by an icon if an email doesn’t match an alias or masked email.

## Composing Emails

- **Replies** use the address the recipient originally contacted.
- **New emails** default to the primary address unless changed in settings.
- **Catch All addresses** – If you own your domain and have catch-all enabled, selecting `*@your-domain.com` allows you to manually enter any address under your domain.

## JMAP: The Key to Advanced Email Handling

These advanced email features are only possible with **JMAP**, a modern email protocol that simplifies handling multiple addresses efficiently.

Mailtemi ensures that managing your emails is as seamless as possible, giving you full control over your inbox.
