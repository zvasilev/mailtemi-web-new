Still there is not uniform support across JMAP servers.
So the app just rely solely on the server to handle send workflow.
To avoid confucssion error handling was extended to preserve server error description and presend it in the UI.

For example 
1. stalw.art server allow any Send Identity(email alias) to be set.
This doesn't guarantee email will be successful be send by this alias. But the server returns correct error when send failed.

2. Cyrus IMAP server.
 - As standalone server do not support update part of the API.
   Also if the users are not created with email adresses the API do not return anythisng.
   So in this case the only possible sollution is to populate email address from setup workflow.
 - As FastMail service is very different story.
