The Android version of Mailtemi is almost ready for its beta release! Here’s a quick update on where things stand:

### What is the current status?

1. **Google Play Console Registration** 
   
   Unfortunately, I’ve hit a snag with the Google Play Console registration. It’s not accepting my phone number (BG), so I’ve filed a support case and am waiting for their response.

2. **Contacts Management**: 

   Right now, the app shows a simple list of supported services like CardDAV, Google People API, and MSGraph People. The screens for viewing and editing contacts are placeholders for the moment. Since Mailtemi is primarily focused on email, these features will be developed in parallel with future updates.
   
3. **On Par Functionality with iOS**
   
   The Android version now matches the iOS version in terms of core features. Everything from certificate validation to securely saving credentials has been implemented following Android's best practices.
   
   
4. **Screenshots – _Mailtemi on Android_**

   Mailtemi leverages Android's latest UI framework, Jetpack Compose. 
   By default, it uses the **Material You** design system, which dynamically adjusts the app’s theme based on the user’s wallpaper. 
   This can be disabled in settings, but I’ve found it makes the interface cleaner and more intuitive—something I’ve grown to appreciate over time.
