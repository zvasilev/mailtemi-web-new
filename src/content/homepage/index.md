    - author: Great Email client!
      organization: Jsfrederick
      rating: five
      content: I really liked this email client. It natively supports JMAP and works VERY well with Fastmail. It’s screaming fast and updates new email quickly. Very pleasant to look at and easy to navigate. I look forward to further development and the addition of new features. Overall a great product. I am willing to pay a modest yearly fee to fund further development.
    - author: Should be \#1 mail app in App Store
      organization: vasan musicbox
      rating: five
      content: "This app ticks all the boxes for me. I tested all others listed in AppStore and find this appealing for following reasons 
      1. No data collection - period. Data linked to you, not linked to you confuses a normal person like me. No data tracking is simple to understand. 2. Ease of configuring mails. I don't use the mainstream email providers, so this is a big deal. Mailtemi does it without a sweat. Sync is very fast and quickly we see results of configuration. 3. Colouring mailboxes works great with the color outlining the message sender avatar. 4. Small little things that can be improved. 1. Mailtemi logo missing in the app. It is too clean. 2. No help to understand icons. The one on bottom left functions weird to me. No contact support or developer option from within the app. 3. This is big miss. Configure swipe actions missing. I am used to swipe and delete. This isn't possible here. This has potential to be a unified mailbox for juggling multiple emails with extreme privacy with continuous development."
    
    - author: Decent JMAP Client
      organization: jcwacky
      rating: four
      content: Was pleased to find a native app that supports JMAP for Fastmail (as their own app isn’t native). The basics work well, but I’d like to see, • In app browser support for links. • Ability to pin/favourite folders. • Ability for it to open the next newest message after archiving etc.

      organization: Haspi2
      rating: five
      content: Initially I was planning to try the app with an JMAP service but I also gave it a try with my Gmail accounts and it worked pretty well so I’ll start using it as my go-to app for email.
