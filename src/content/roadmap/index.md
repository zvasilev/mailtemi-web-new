  feature_list:
    - icon: "tabler:notification"  
      title: Push Notifications
      content: Will be limited to JMAP, MSGraph, and GMail API, which offer this notification mechanisms.<br><br>IMAP cannot achieve push notifications without requiring access to the user's password, which is not acceptable and will not be supported.
    - icon: "tabler:users"  
      title: JMAP Contacts
      content: We're closely following the development of the JMAP Contacts specification. <br> Once it has completed the RFC process, we plan to support it in our application. <br>This will allow us to provide even more robust and efficient contact management features.
