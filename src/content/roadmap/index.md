      content: Will be limited to JMAP, MSGraph, and GMail API, which offer this notification mechanisms.<br><br>IMAP cannot achieve push notifications without requiring access to the user's password, which is not acceptable and will not be supported.

      title: JMAP Contacts
      content: We're closely following the development of the JMAP Contacts specification. <br> Once it has completed the RFC process, we plan to support it in our application. <br>This will allow us to provide even more robust and efficient contact management features.
    - icon: "tabler:calendar"  
      title: JMAP Calendars
      content: Calendaring is complex and a long-term goal. <br>To become a fully-featured collaboration app, we are committed to adding JMAP calendar support in the future.
